Urban Farming Sensor Data Monitoring System
This project implements a real-time Agriculture Monitoring System using an ESP32 microcontroller to monitor various environmental parameters essential for farming. The system integrates the following sensors and features:

Features:
DHT11 Sensor: Measures the temperature and humidity levels in the environment.

Soil Moisture Sensor: Monitors the soil moisture to control irrigation (activating a relay when the soil is dry).

Rain Sensor: Detects the presence of rain.

Web Interface: Real-time data display via a responsive web page, showing temperature, humidity, soil moisture, and rain sensor status.

Data Visualization: Sensor data can be visualized as a chart, with the ability to download sensor readings in CSV format.

Relay Control: The relay is activated when the soil moisture level is below the predefined threshold, triggering irrigation.

Hardware:
ESP32: Used for Wi-Fi connectivity and sensor management.

DHT11: Humidity and temperature sensor.

Soil Moisture Sensor: Analog sensor to detect moisture levels in the soil.

Rain Sensor: Digital sensor to detect rainfall.

Relay Module: Controls irrigation based on soil moisture levels.

LCD: Displays the ESP32â€™s IP address for easy access to the web interface.

Key Benefits:
Remote Monitoring: View real-time sensor data through any browser.

Charting and Analytics: Visualize the collected data using interactive charts.

CSV Data Export: Download the sensor data for further analysis.

This project is useful for urban farming, home gardening, and smart agriculture applications, helping automate and monitor key environmental factors for better crop growth.
