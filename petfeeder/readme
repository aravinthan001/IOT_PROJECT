Pet Monitoring System with ESP8266
This project implements a Pet Monitoring System using the ESP8266. The system integrates an ultrasonic sensor, a buzzer, and a servo motor with a web interface to monitor and control the system remotely.

Features:
Wi-Fi Connectivity: Access the system remotely using a browser.

Intruder Detection: Uses an ultrasonic sensor to detect objects within 20 cm and triggers an alert (buzzer and status update).

Real-time Status: The LCD and web interface display real-time information about the system status (SAFE or GO OUTSIDE).

Servo Control: Toggle a servo motor using the web interface to simulate control over a gate or door.

Buzzer: Sounds when an intruder is detected.

Web Interface:
The status is updated every second to show the current state of the system (either SAFE or GO OUTSIDE).

A button allows you to control the servo motor, switching it between ON and OFF positions.

How to Use:
Connect the system to your Wi-Fi network.

Access the IP address displayed on the LCD screen from your browser to monitor and control the system.

Toggle the servo control using the provided button on the web interface.
