ESP32 Early Warning System
This project is an Early Warning System powered by the ESP32. It reads data from multiple sensors and allows users to view and download sensor data via a web interface. The system includes:

DHT11 for temperature and humidity monitoring.

Ultrasonic sensor for distance measurement.

Rain sensor to detect wet conditions.

Water Flow sensor to measure water flow.

GPS Module for real-time location tracking.

Features
Real-time display of temperature, humidity, distance, water flow rate, rain status, and GPS location.

Ability to view sensor data on a web interface.

Download collected data in CSV format.

Data is stored in SPIFFS for persistent logging.

Rain status (Dry/Raining) based on the input from the rain sensor.
