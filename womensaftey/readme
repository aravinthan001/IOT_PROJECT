Women Safety GPS and Alert System
This project uses an ESP8266 microcontroller, a GPS module, an OLED display, and a web interface to track and share location data in case of emergency. The system also allows users to toggle the "Help Needed" status with a button and share their location via a web interface.

Features
GPS Tracking: Displays the current location using latitude and longitude from the GPS module.

Help Request Button: Allows the user to toggle a "Help Needed" status by pressing a physical button.

Web Interface: Displays GPS coordinates and help status, and provides options to:

View the location on Google Maps.

Get directions to the current location.

Share the location via email.

OLED Display: Shows current GPS coordinates, help status, and the IP address of the ESP8266.

Components Needed
ESP8266: A Wi-Fi microcontroller to connect to the internet and host the web server.

GPS Module: A GPS receiver to track the device's location.

OLED Display (128x64): A small display to show the current location and help status.

Button: A physical button to toggle the "Help Needed" status.

Wi-Fi Network: A network to which the ESP8266 can connect for internet access.

Libraries Used
Adafruit_SSD1306: For controlling the OLED display.

TinyGPSPlus: For decoding GPS data and handling location information.

ESPAsyncWebServer: For hosting the web interface.

ESP8266WiFi: For connecting the ESP8266 to the Wi-Fi network
