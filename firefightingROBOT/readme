Fire Fighting Robot with ESP32
This project is a Fire Fighting Robot built using the ESP32. The robot is designed to detect fire, move autonomously, and spray water in response to fire detection. The system is controlled via a web interface hosted by the ESP32, allowing the user to manually control the robot's movements and activate/deactivate the water pump.

Key Features:

Fire Detection: Monitors flame sensor for fire detection.

Movement Control: Allows manual control of robot movement (forward, backward, left, right, stop).

Water Pump Control: Manages the activation and deactivation of a water pump to extinguish flames.

Servo Control: Adjusts the position of a water tube's head to spray water.

Web Interface: Provides an easy-to-use interface for manual operation and control.

Wi-Fi Connectivity: The robot can be controlled remotely through any device connected to the same network.

Accessing the System:

Connect the ESP32 to your Wi-Fi network, and the robotâ€™s IP address will be displayed on the LCD screen.

Use a web browser to control the robot and view the flame sensor status.
