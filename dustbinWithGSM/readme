Smart Garbage Bin System with SMS Alert
This project implements a Smart Garbage Bin System that detects when the garbage bin is full and sends an SMS notification to a predefined phone number. The system utilizes various sensors such as an IR Sensor, Ultrasonic Sensor, and a Servo Motor to automate the operation and inform the user about the garbage bin status.

Features:
Ultrasonic Sensor: Measures the garbage level in the bin. If the distance is below a certain threshold (indicating the bin is full), the system sends an SMS alert.

IR Sensor: Detects when a person is nearby and opens the garbage bin lid accordingly.

Servo Motor: Controls the garbage bin lid to open when a person is detected.

ISD1820 Voice Module: Plays a voice message when a person is detected near the garbage bin.

SMS Alert: Sends a message to a specified phone number when the garbage bin is full.

Components:
ESP32: Used to control the sensors and interface with the GSM module for SMS functionality.

IR Sensor: Detects the presence of a person near the garbage bin.

Ultrasonic Sensor: Measures the distance to the garbage level.

Servo Motor: Opens or closes the bin lid.

GSM Module: Sends SMS notifications when the bin is full.

ISD1820 Voice Module: Plays a message when a person is detected.

LCD Display: Displays the garbage bin distance and other relevant information.

Key Benefits:
Automated Operation: The system automatically opens the bin lid when a person is detected and closes it when they leave.

SMS Notification: Get notified when the garbage bin is full and needs to be emptied.

Easy Integration: The system is easy to set up and can be modified to fit different use cases.

How It Works:
Person Detection: When a person is detected by the IR sensor, the servo motor opens the garbage bin lid, and a voice message is played using the ISD1820 module.

Garbage Level Measurement: The ultrasonic sensor continuously measures the garbage level. If the garbage level falls below a defined threshold, an SMS is sent to the specified phone number to alert the user.

SMS Alert: If the bin is full, the system sends an SMS notification and avoids sending multiple SMS alerts until the bin is emptied.
